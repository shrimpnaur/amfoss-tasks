## INTRODUCTION
Hello everybody !!
I am Shria Nair from second year CSE-Core dept. Talking about myself, I have a huge thing for creativity. Creativity in Art or be it creativity in the technical field. The passion for learning in me is the same as the passion I have for Art, Music and Photography. To sum it all up, I absolutely LOVE to learn, be it anything and everything.

## WHY YOU MUST CHOOSE ME?
Like I said, my passion for gaining knowledge really gets the best out of me. I am very much familiarised with coding with so much to learn more and I am all up for it so as to enjoy the process and the problem solving to enhance my skills and give my best to whatever work I am working upon with the utmost dedication. I personally believe that AmFOSS IS the right place for all of it.

## WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
I want to learn the skills that I find interesting to understand the domain i wanna work in a little more deeply, and also enhance my coding along with focusing on my academics to push myself hard to achieve my goal.

## HOW DO YOU INTEND TO CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
Initially I would completely try to understand how everything in the club works along with learning from like-minded people about various technologies and events that might help me build my skills. I would participate in club activities and keep on learning from courses, mentors and contribute to projects and participate in hackathons.

## WHAT ARE YOUR FIELDS OF INTEREST, AND HOW DO YOU PLAN ON WORKING ON THEM?
My field of interest currently lies in Full Stack and Web Dev but I am just exploring more and more till I find THE perfect domain for myself, till then I just plan on learning new skills and technologies which might help me achieve what i want in this journey.

## WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND FEEDBACK ON THE PRAVESHAN SELECTION PROCESS?
A lot of these tasks very really fun to do without having much to stress upon and just learning a lot of concepts and apply it but some of the tasks were really mind boggling to finish and made me a little exhausted but at the end of the day, i learnt. I learnt a lot of things from these tasks itself so I am really excited to know what is in store for me if I get a chance to join the club !!
