## HELLO WORLD

This task was easy for some language and some sub-tasks, and for the others I had to rely on a lot of google sites to understand the logic of reading files and printing diamonds. I also learnt about different types of languages and their use and syntax. I am curious about Rust and GOLANG so I might just try to learn little bit more about them at the same time enhance my coding skills in python, js, java, C (languages I already have an idea about.
