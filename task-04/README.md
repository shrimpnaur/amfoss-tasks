## GOPAL'S PAGEPAL
Phew that was reaaally fun. The funny thing is I had doubts if I could finish this task at all or not because my BotFather was not replying to me (that is what I thought) but turns out I was contacting the wrong BotFather this entire time cause there a lot out there :') my bad. But after getting the token and my API key, I was all set to dedicate my time to make this Bot and honestly it was a very fun process !!

## INITIAL STEPS:
I first saw a few videos and checked a few websites for knowing the pre-requisites. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-telegram-bot-using-python/ this site from freecodecamp helped me start with it and I understood the requirements for PagePal and also how I can make functions work for it. The next step I did was customize the Bot, put commands, description and a profile picture for it from the assets folder.
Next up I noted down all the commands I need in this bot and understood the type of things those commands would do for the users.
https://youtu.be/NwBWW8cNCP4?si=cr9UZ_WhHgSpT8yd this video from CS dojo also helped my understand how I can implement functions with a lot of other videos and sites.

I had faced issues in the /book command as it was not able to fetch the data properly but after observing the code and trying some debug statements i finally got the issue so I did not have to sit with that for a long time.
I also understood how responses work in this part.

## FINAL STEPS:
The next part was implementation of the /list command which has to ask users to give /reading_list command for them to get options to add, delete or view their reading list document. This part actually took a lot of time for me but I knew I can do it so I tried with a lot of debug statements and if-else to understand what is wrong and finally got it correct with it initialising a document if it is not present in the system and then proceeding further with the other functions. I also got to know about buttons with https://youtu.be/0XJJCvpe7as?si=IjEKDYOeXeGBRFKb this particular video and applied the same in it.

Similarly I finished implementing the deleting command and viewing command and thought its over until I tried testing it. Well this is actually the part i took the most time. Trying to check every command and also trying to run it and understood what all this code lacks. I took note of all of it and tried adding all of it in my code to make it fully functioning. For the final touch, I took help of https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#user-guide this site to decorate the look of the document, not much but still tried something. Even though this bot is not a high end bot but I think this was a great learning experience for me and I genuinely enjoyed it the most !!
