# TerminalTrolly

Greetings, Shoppers! Welcome to THE FOOTSHOP.

I know what you are thinking. "why is it named FOOTSHOP and there aint a single foot item?". Honestly I dont know I just liked the Logo so yeah that is the reason.

Anyway, this task was a personal stress buster for me as I will talk about this in the blog post. Starting from fixing the broken terminal to making the contents of the bill, I thoroughly enjoyed this process A LOT.
Personally I learnt a lot even though I could only make a basic layout but still I did. 

There were times when I got a little frustrated with my imagination and the execution but a lot of surfing the web, and i mean A LOT, helped me get somewhere with this project.

# INITIAL STAGE:
The first step was to check the given code and the fault in it and make it right. I checked the index.html and it gave a basic layout of the product catalog and the terminal window so I knew after watching the demo that I have to work with this and add elements to this. 
Then I went to check the style.css and saw the styling for some of the elements and the terminal window. (I got to know about the terminal styling and everything because of this task). Hence I started working on that.
Next I checked the script.js to check what was the faulty code and carefully observed it.
The errors were:




Now came the part where I had to make it a fully functioning E-Commerce wesbsite.

 You have to fetch the assets needed from the API we have provided. The design can be customized freely while ensuring it contains all the elements shown in the demo.

Your next objective is to integrate functional commands into the terminal. Below are the commands to implement along with their descriptions:

- list: Display all available products.
- details 'product_id': View details of a specific product identified by its ID.
- add 'product_id': Add a specific product to your cart using its ID.
- remove 'product id': To remove the product from the cart
- cart: View the current items in your cart.
- buy: Proceed to a new webpage where you can review items in your cart along with the total price, enabling you to finalize your purchase.
- clear: Clear the terminal screen.
- search 'product_name': Search a product by name.
- sort 'price/name': Sort the products based on the price or the name.

Implementing these commands will make the terminal interactive and functional. The "buy" command, in particular, should lead to a webpage displaying your cart contents and total price, facilitating the checkout process.

Your creativity, as well as the design and functionality of the UI and the terminal, will be evaluated. Remember to ensure the webpage is responsive!
