## TERMINAL TROLLY:

# Initial-Steps
1. First I checked the resource given in the repository and I saw that I was given a code for terminal based website and I knew that I had to implement all the changes in it.
2. I started looking at the site from where I  had to fetch the products from and honestly that was such a great resource. After knowing how to fetch the data and trying to run the code given in the FakeStoreAPI.
3. Then I started to focus on making the user interface first with html and css and tried to make it minimalistic yet good looking and made another page for checkout as well.
4. The checkout page was very basic first but I tried making it a little more good looking but still I am not really satisfied with the results.

## Things to note.
1. The add function and remove function work on product ID which is given by numbers for eg Product ID 1 and so on.
2. The buy does not redirect to any other page and also I for some reason was not able to make the icons for the header as shown in the demo video so I tried customising it in my own way.
