## TERMINAL TROLLY:

# Initial-Steps
1. First I checked the resource given in the repository and I saw that I was given a code for terminal based website and I knew that I had to implement all the changes in it.
2. I started looking at the site from where I  had to fetch the products from and honestly that was such a great resource. After knowing how to fetch the data and trying to run the code given in the FakeStoreAPI.
3. Then I started to focus on making the user interface first with html and css and tried to make it minimalistic yet good looking and made another page for checkout as well.
4. The checkout page was very basic first but I tried making it a little more good looking but still I am not really satisfied with the results.

## Things to note.
1. The add function and remove function work on product ID which is given by numbers for eg Product ID 1 and so on.
2. The buy does not redirect to any other page and also I for some reason was not able to make the icons for the header as shown in the demo video so I tried customising it in my own way.
3. ``` <audio id="welcome-audio" src="Welcome - Sound Effect.mp3" preload="auto"></audio> ``` tried adding this just to make it a little more fun
4. I realised that I couldve used loop to code the entire product catalog to make the code shorter. Kept this in mind for future.
5. Made the website responsive too.
6. Showed the total price by calculating the total amount into quantity of it.


I enjoyed this task as this was one of my comfort tasks where I just kept on learning more and understood more js concepts and tried implementing it.
Hoping to make more projects like these.
