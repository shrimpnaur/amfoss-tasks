# Documentation for Spicetify Themes

## Overview
Spicetify provides a robust and flexible way to personalize your Spotify experience with custom themes, extensions, and scripts. Its features allow users to control the look and feel of Spotify in detail, ensuring a completely unique interface. Whether you prefer minimalism, vibrant colors, or additional functionality, Spicetify empowers you to shape Spotify to match your tastes and is backed by an open-source community where users actively contribute new themes, extensions, and features.

The Spicetify customization process involves modifying Spotifyâ€™s UI elements through CSS and color configuration. By creating a custom color.ini and CSS file, users can redefine the look and feel of the Spotify desktop app. Below is a breakdown of how the theme's features and elements work:

(Check all the themes preview in THEMES.MD file)

Every theme should contain:

-color.ini: store colors value that later will be converted to CSS variables
-user.css: set of custom CSS rules to manipulate, hide, move UI elements.


## EXAMPLE THEME: BURNT SIENNA

Theme Components
1. Color Palette
The color.ini file defines the colors used across various UI components, ensuring consistency throughout the theme.

```ini

[Base]
button        = ef8450    # Defines the button color, a vibrant shade of orange
sidebar       = 242629    # Dark gray background for the sidebar
player        = 242629    # Dark gray for the player background
main          = 303336    # Main content area in a slightly lighter dark gray
button-active = ef8450    # Active button color, matching the default button color

```

2. Font Styling
The imported Google Font Montserrat is used across the entire interface to provide a clean, modern appearance.

``` css

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@100;900&display=swap');
* {
    font-family: Montserrat;
