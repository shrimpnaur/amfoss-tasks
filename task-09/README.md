# HERO DEX

This was the last task I started working on after watching flutter app tutorials, even though it was a tad bit difficult, I tried doing it but I was not able to get the output I wanted and in the end the emulator took a lot of space as my partitioned disk space was getting too full, hence the emulator was not working and my laptop was hanging a lot. During the last days I was just trying to get storage and at the same time trying to code for the app. I was not able to do it as I was relying on AI a lot and realised that is not the point of these tasks, hence I could not finish it in the given time. Though I plan on learning flutter till I get caught up with my college work.

My next step is to clean up the disk space properly and then continue with the app to complete this task too. 

I till now learnt the different pages making part and the entire widget logic of flutter.
Also had set up the json file containing the superhero data in the assets folder and was named heroes.json. The pubspec.yaml should include:

flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/heroes.json
