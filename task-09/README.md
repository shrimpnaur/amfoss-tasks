# HERO DEX

This was the last task I started working on after watching flutter app tutorials, even though it was hard I tried doing it but I was not able to get the output I wanted and in the end the emulator took a lot of space as my partitioned disk space was getting too full, hence the emulator was not working and my laptop was hanging a lot. During the last days I was just trying to get storage and at the same time trying to code for the app. I was not able to do it as I was relying on AI a lot and realised that is not the point of these tasks, hence I could not finish it in the given time. Though I plan on learning flutter till I get caught up with my college work.
