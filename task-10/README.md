## OPERATION-PIXEL-MERGE

This task was worth all the efforts when I saw the final output image. 
The first step was to sort the images which I tried doing through the terminal and not by the python code, but then I put that part in the code too as it was one of the requirements. 
Next step was to find the color and coordinates, for this I first tried to detect the dot and then find its color and coordinates. watched a lot of open cv tutorials as I could not find the exact resource I wanted, though geeksforgeeks helped me with the detection process.

Initially my mistake was that I did all the steps seperate rather than all together, that is after sorting, I made a code to detect each and every single picture's color and coordinate seperately and used my brain a lot, even tried drawing the secret image. I realised this process was too time consuming and hence decided I will just do it all together. 
So I tried to watch videos or check links which closely resembled the work I wanted my code to do and tried testing and modifying them, took a bit of help from AI to get a more logical approach to the code and also helped me with the errors.

The last part was to implement pillow to stitch the images with the color of the previous dot and put a break for blank images and then finally after a lot, i mean A LOT of testing, i finally got the final output !! It was all worth it. I enjoyed the task.
